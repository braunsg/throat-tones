Party girls don't get hurt<br>
Can't feel anything, when will I learn<br>
I push it down, push it down

<div class="lyric_block">
I'm the one "for a good time call"<br>
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell<br>
I feel the love, feel the love

1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink<br>
1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink<br>

Throw 'em back, till I lose count

<div class="lyric_block">
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier<br>
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist<br>
Like it doesn't exist<br>
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry<br>
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

<div class="lyric_block">
But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes<br>
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes<br>
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
On for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess<br>
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this<br>
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame<br>
