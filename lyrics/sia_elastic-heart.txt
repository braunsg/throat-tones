And another one bites the dust<br>
Oh why can I not conquer love?<br>
And I might have thought that we were one<br>
Wanted to fight this war without weapons<br>
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad<br>
But there were so many red flags<br>
Now another one bites the dust<br>
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
You did not break me<br>
I'm still fighting for peace
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,<br>
But your blade—it might be too sharp<br>
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,<br>
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast<br>
But you won't see me fall apart<br>
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I've got an elastic heart<br>
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
And I will stay up through the night<br>
And let's be clear, won't close my eyes<br>
And I know that I can survive<br>
I'll walk through fire to save my life
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
And I want it, I want my life so bad<br>
I'm doing everything I can<br>
Then another one bites the dust<br>
It's hard to lose a chosen one
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
You did not break me<br>
(You did not break me, no)<br>
I'm still fighting for peace

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,<br>
But your blade—it might be too sharp<br>
