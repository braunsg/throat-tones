<div class="lyric_block">
I was born in a thunderstorm<br>
I grew up overnight<br>
I played alone<br>
I played on my own<br>
I survived
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
Hey<br>
I wanted everything I never had<br>
Like the love that comes with light<br>
I wore envy and I hated that<br>
But I survived
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go<br>
Where the wind don't change<br>
And nothing in the ground can ever grow<br>
No hope, just lies<br>
And you're taught to cry in your pillow<br>
But I survived
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing<br>
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I found solace in the strangest place<br>
Way in the back of my mind<br>
I saw my life in a stranger's face<br>
And it was mine
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go<br>
Where the wind don't change<br>
And nothing in the ground can ever grow<br>
No hope, just lies<br>
And you're taught to cry in your pillow<br>
But I survived
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing<br>
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
You took it all, but I'm still breathing<br>
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I had made every single mistake<br>
That you could ever possibly make<br>
I took and I took and I took what you gave<br>
But you never noticed that I was in pain<br>
I knew what I wanted, I went in and got it<br>
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't<br>
I told you that I would never be forgotten<br>
And all in spite of you
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing<br>
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing<br>
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)<br>
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)<br>
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)<br>
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)<br>
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)<br>
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)<br>
I'm alive
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive<br>
I'm alive
