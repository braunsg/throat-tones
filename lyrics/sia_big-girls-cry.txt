<div class="lyric_block">
Tough girl<br>
In the fast lane<br>
No time for love<br>
No time for hate<br>
No drama no time<br>
For games<br>
Tough girl<br>
Whose soul aches
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I'm at home<br>
On my own<br>
Check my phone<br>
Nothing though<br>
Act busy<br>
Order in<br>
Pay TV<br>
It's agony
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I may cry, ruining my makeup<br>
Wash away all the things you've taken<br>
And I don't care if I don't look pretty<br>
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking<br>
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking<br>
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
Tough girl<br>
I'm in pain<br>
It's lonely at the top<br>
Blackouts and airplanes<br>
I still pour you a glass of champagne<br>
Tough girl<br>
Whose soul aches
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I'm at home<br>
On my own<br>
Check my phone<br>
Nothing though<br>

<div class="lyric_block">
I may cry, ruining my makeup<br>
Wash away all the things you've taken<br>
And I don't care if I don't look pretty<br>
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking<br>
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking<br>
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

<div class="lyric_block">
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up<br>
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up<br>
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up<br>
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up,<br>
I wake up alone
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I may cry, ruining my makeup<br>

Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking<br>
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
