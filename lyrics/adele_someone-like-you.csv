time,lyric
2,I heard that you're settled down
9.5,That you found a girl and you're married now.
18,I heard that your dreams came true.
23.8,Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
31.5,"Old friend, why are you so shy?"
38,Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.
46,I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
49,"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it."
52.6,I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over.
,
62.2,"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
68,I wish nothing but the best for you too
75.2,"Don't forget me, I beg"
78.6,"I'll remember you said,"
82.2,"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
100.2,You know how the time flies
105.4,Only yesterday was the time of our lives
112.5,We were born and raised
115.9,In a summer haze
119.7,Bound by the surprise of our glory days
127,I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
130.8,"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it."
134.3,I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
138,That for me it isn't over.
146,"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
152,I wish nothing but the best for you two 
159,"Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah"
174,Nothing compares
175,No worries or cares
177,Regrets and mistakes
179,They are memories made.
181,Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
193,"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
198,I wish nothing but the best for you
206,"Don't forget me, I beg"
209,"I'll remember you said,"
213,Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.
221,"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
227,I wish nothing but the best for you too
234,"Don't forget me, I beg"
238,"I'll remember you said,"
241,"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."
