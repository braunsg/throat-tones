I heard that you're settled down<br>
That you found a girl and you're married now.<br>
I heard that your dreams came true.<br>
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.<br>
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
Old friend, why are you so shy?<br>
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.<br>
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited<br>
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.<br>
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded<br>
That for me it isn't over.<br>
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you too<br>
Don't forget me, I beg<br>
I'll remember you said,<br>
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"<br>
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
You know how the time flies<br>
Only yesterday was the time of our lives<br>
We were born and raised<br>
In a summer haze<br>
Bound by the surprise of our glory days<br>

Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you two<br>
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah<br>

<div class="lyric_block">
Nothing compares<br>
No worries or cares<br>
Regrets and mistakes<br>
They are memories made.<br>
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?<br>
