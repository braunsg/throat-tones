<div class="lyric_block">
There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark<br>
Finally I can see you crystal clear<br>
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare<br>
See how I leave with every piece of you<br>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch<br>
And it's bringing me out the dark

<div class="lyric_block">
The scars of your love remind me of us<br>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br>
I can't help feeling<br>
We could have had it all<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
And you played it, to the beat<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
</div>
<div class="lyric_block">
Baby, I have no story to be told<br>
But I've heard one on you<br>
And I'm gonna make your head burn<br>
Think of me in the depths of your despair<br>
Make a home down there<br>
As mine sure won't be shared

Rolling in the deep<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br>

Throw your soul through every open door (woah)<br>
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)<br>
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)<br>
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)<br>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
We could have had it all<br>

We could have had it all<br>

It all, it all, it all<br>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
